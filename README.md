## Project Overview üìú
This repository was made to meet requirements for the ASM Lab (Assignment 2) as part of coursework in MTRX2700 (Mechatronics 2) at the **University of Sydney**. The code is mostly in the **C** coding language and was written for, and tested on, **STM32F3 Discovery** micro-controllers.  

The code is broken into separate modules, with sub-tasks for each module, each entailing their own respective files. Descriptions of each task, and how to run the code are explained in the drop-downs in the **Module Overview** section.  

It is recommended to create a new project in **STM32CubeIDE** using the downloaded Git repository (see details below). You can then run each sub-project by navigating into its respective directory or by manually copying individual files into a new project.

### How to Download the Repo ‚¨áÔ∏è
Clone the repository in your terminal using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samrogerrs/MTRX2700-Assignment-2.git
   ```
Note that the repository is not publically available, for reasons pertaining to academic integrity.

<summary><strong>Exercise 1 - Digital I/O üí°</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Task 1A</strong></summary>

#### Description
This module makes it easy to control the LEDs and respond to button presses on the STM32F303 Discovery board. When you set it up, pressing the user button automatically toggles between lighting the top half and bottom half of the board's LEDs.

#### Usage
To use this module, include the dio_init() call:

```c
#include "dio.h"

//main function - loop
int main(void)
{
    // initialise digital i/o
    dio_init();

    // loop 4ever
    for(;;) {
    }
}
```

#### Testing
To check if everything is working:

1. Load the program onto your STM32F303 Discovery board
2. When it starts running, you should see the bottom half of the LEDs light up
3. Press the blue user button on the board
4. The top half of LEDs should now light up (and the bottom half should turn off)
5. Press the button again and it should switch back

<summary><strong>Task 1B</strong></summary>

#### Description
This module makes it easy to control the LEDs and respond to button presses on the STM32F303 Discovery board. When you set it up, pressing the user button automatically toggles between lighting the top half and bottom half of the board's LEDs. You can customize the button behavior by passing your own callback function.

#### Usage
To use this module with a custom button handler:
```c
#include "dio.h"

// Define what happens when button is pressed
void button_pressed(void)
{
    dio_toggle_led_halves();
}

// Main function - loop
int main(void)
{
    // Initialize digital I/O with callback
    dio_init(&button_pressed);
    
    // Loop forever
    for(;;) {
    }
}
```

#### Testing
To check if everything is working:
1. Load the program onto your STM32F303 Discovery board
2. When it starts running, the bottom half of the LEDs should light up
3. Press the blue user button on the board
4. The top half of LEDs should now light up (and the bottom half should turn off)
5. Press the button again and it should switch back

<summary><strong>Task 1C</strong></summary>

#### Description
This module makes it easy to control the LEDs and respond to button presses on the STM32F303 Discovery board. The LED state is encapsulated within the module and can only be accessed through get/set functions. When you set it up, pressing the user button toggles between lighting the top half and bottom half of the board's LEDs.

#### Usage
To use this module with get/set functions for LED control:
```c
#include "dio.h"

// Define what happens when button is pressed
void button_pressed(void)
{
    uint8_t current_state = dio_get_led_state();
    
    // Check which half is currently lit
    if ((current_state & 0xF0) == 0xF0) {
        // Switch to bottom half
        dio_set_led_state(0x0F);
    } else {
        // Switch to top half
        dio_set_led_state(0xF0);
    }
}

// Main function - loop
int main(void)
{
    // Initialize digital I/O with callback
    dio_init(&button_pressed);
    
    // Set initial LED state (bottom half lit)
    dio_set_led_state(0x0F);
    
    // Loop forever
    for(;;) {
        // Interrupts handle all processing
    }
}
```

#### Testing
To check if everything is working:
1. Load the program onto your STM32F303 Discovery board
2. When it starts running, the bottom half of the LEDs should light up
3. Press the blue user button on the board
4. The top half of LEDs should now light up (and the bottom half should turn off)
5. Press the button again and it should switch back

<summary><strong>Task 3B</strong></summary>

#### **Description**
This task recieves an input string of characters from the PC serial communication terminal, which it will read character by character before storing it in memory on the microcontroller.

#### **Usage**
First open CuteCom (Mac) or PuTTY (Windows) and connect to the USB port you have connected to the microcontroller, as well as choosing the appropriate baud rate (115200 in this case). Then, debug `assembly.s` in the STM32CubeIDE and manually step through the code until line 39 is reached:
```assembly
	loop_forever:
    	LDR R0, =USART1            @ Load base address of UART
```
You will then resume the code by pressing F8, and send the given string using the CuteCom serial communication terminal. Suspend the code. To check that the message has been recieved, enable Memory Browser, and paste in the address that is currently stored in `R6`. The resulting hex values stored at this address will be displayed, as well as the ASCII representation on the far right where your string should now be stored.
The program has allocated for 62 bytes (or 62 ASCII characters) to be transmitted as seen in lines 13-17 of `assembly.s`. 
```assembly
	@ Allocate space for the incoming buffer
	incoming_buffer: .byte 62
	
	@ Store the size of the buffer
	incoming_counter: .byte 62
```
If you wish to transmit a longer message, you will need to increase the buffer and counter sizes accordingly.

## Testing and Troubleshooting üß™
### Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Move all files from each folder in this project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.
2. Open STM32CubeIDE and import the project files as necessary.
3. Build the project and ensure there are no errors.


### Debugging üêû
- To debug your program in STM32CubeIDE:
  1. Click on **Debug** to start the debugging process.
  2. Once debugging starts, click **Resume** to run the program.
  3. Transmit your data via serial communication using your chosen serial monitor tool.
  4. Click **Pause** in STM32CubeIDE to inspect what was received.


- Make sure all dependencies are installed and properly configured.
- If the IDE does not detect the STM32F3Discovery board, try restarting your IDE or reconnecting the board.
- If using a MAC, the dongle connectors can be temperamental. Try unplugging and retrying
- Ensure serial connections are properly established between the boards if required
