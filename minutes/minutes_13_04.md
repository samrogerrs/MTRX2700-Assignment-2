## Minutes

### 1. Checked Everyone Had Local Copy of Latest Version
- Still having issues downloaded entire Git repository, instead having to do one file at a time. 

### 2. Checked Integration Functionality
- Integration works correctly on 2/3 boards with no bugs. Connor was having issues with board, but because it was same code it might have just been bugging out/overheating, or a small error in downloading git as a local copy causing a bug. Confident that integration is working. 

### 3. Set soft deadline for README file
- Deadline set for Monday night. This will enable us to read over each other's sections and ensure we can all understand every part of the code and how it works together.
